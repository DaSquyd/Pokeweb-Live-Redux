Using Tinke or editor.exe (kiwids), open the ROM and unpack the a/2/8/2 narc so that you get the individual files.
Go to wherever you exported the folder to, and you'll have 80 files. The only ones we care about are 0-31, as the rest are empty (zero byte size).
Using the table of File -> Ingame Location posted in the reply above this post, choose which vendor you will edit.
Note that location 1 might be named file 0.
The generic vendors at the marts sell items based on how many badges you have.
Specialty vendors have unique tables and don't appear in multiple locations.
[*]Open the location in HxD or other hex editor of choice; the way the file is structured is just a list of items (by hex) that will be sold by the vendor.

[*]Replace or add/delete items.

[*]Save the location file.

[*]Repack the narc, replace the old narc with the new. Save the ROM and you're done.
