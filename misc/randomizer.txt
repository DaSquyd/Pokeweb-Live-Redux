Trainer Viability Alg
	(bst -  min(sp_atk, atk)) * viability_mod(customizable) * item_mod * ability_mod * trainer_id_mod

	bst = base stat total - the lower of sp_atk, atk
	viability_mod = custom defined value that increases or decreases viability
	item_mod = custom defined value that increases or decreases viability based on chosen item
	ability_mod = custom defined value that increases or decreases viability based on chosen ability
	trainer_id_mod = custom defined value that increases or decreases viability based on specific trainer (optionals/bosses)





Items: Lightball, Soul Dew


SS-tier: Huge Power, Drizzle, Pure Power, Wonderguard
S-tier: Guts, Drought, Intimidate, Adaptability, Contrary, Toxic Boost, Multiscale, Serene Grace, No Guard, Storm Drain, Sturdy, Water Absorb, Lightningrod

Encounter Viability Alg
	if sp_atk - atk < 20%
		(bst - avg(sp_atk, atk)) * viability_mod(customizable) * ability_mod
	else
		bst - min(sp_atk, atk)) * viability_mod(customizable) * ability_mod


	if special attack and attack are close, use the avg, otherwise use the greater of the two
	use avg of all ability_mod values because they all have a chance to show up

Move Choosing Alg: 
	Use Smogon Set > lvl 40
	defined bp ranges for each modBST range

	1-2 stab moves depending on type and max(sp_atk, atk) or rand(sp_atk, atk) if they're close enough
	(0-1) status move, either last learnset status move, or random smogon status move
	1 either status move same criteria as above ^ or random coverage move bp scaled to lvl
	(0-1) either status move same criteria as above ^ or random coverage move bp scaled to lvl
	(0-1) first option again if still room && only 1 stab move chosen
	(0-1) random coverage if still room



	stab/coverage move chooser:
		given viability range 30-400

		target bp = 1.01^(avg(bst) - 60) + 40 

		given pokemon viability 500

		52.5 / (500 / 350) = moveBP = 36.9

		given pokemon viability 200

		52.5 / (200/350) = moveBP = 92

		Identify target bp for move type
		Search all moves. Rand(round up or down). Get closest move
		Use learnset moves for stab, if none found, use all moves
		Use all moves for coverage


IVs Alg:
	rand ability
	Get desired natures from smogon
	get natures with same beneficial stat
	brute force natures until one is found
	else ivs 255

Item Alg: 
	80% random from smogon + 20%[sitrus, lum, leftoevers]


Team Building Alg
	create viability pool based on viability range and types
	
	Monotype/Limited Typing
		1: Choose random mon from pool with 2 types
		2: List out types mon is weak too
		3: Choose random mon from pool 
		
	Non-Monotype
		1: Choose random mon from pool
		2: List out types mon is weak too
		3: Choose random mon from pool supereffective against these types, if not found choose random
		4: repeat

Encounter table alg
	given viability range, types, lvl range x-x+2
	maintain global list of used encounters, evolution line cannot appear more than twice

		get all pokemon, including evos in range

		20 lvl x rand from pool
		20 lvl x rand from pool
		10 lvl x rand from pool
		10 lvl x rand from pool
		10 lvl x rand from pool
		10 lvl x rand from pool
		5  lvl x + 1 rand from bottom_fifth_viability from pool
		5  lvl x + 1 rand from top_fifth_viability from pool
		4  lvl x + 1 rand from bottom_fifth_viability from pool
		4  lvl x + 1 rand from top_fifth_viability from pool
		1  lvl x + 2 rand from bottom_fifth_viability from pool
		1  lvl x + 2 rand from top_fifth_viability from pool


		60 lvl x rand from pool
		30 lvl x rand from pool
		5  lvl x rand from pool
		4  lvl x rand from pool
		1  lvl x rand from pool


	ensure early game has certain monotype enounter tables (fire, ghost, water)
