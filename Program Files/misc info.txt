I noticed that the attacks are listed one after the other. For Black and White, it goes TM01-92, but then HM01-06, then TM93-95 back to back starting at offset 0x0009AAB8.

I've got this handy table for people to download, as I couldn't find a similar resource: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnIIigcwlIaNdDBaTm9lX200eVFsdTVlbGpCcWUtWXc&usp=sharing

It lists the current TMs with number and index number in reversed hex. It lists all moves with their reversed index number. This makes for very quick and dirty editing.
