After seeing the success of GMX and Synthetix, I'm convinced that the most straightforward path for for any up and coming L1 to gain sticky tvl is to ensure a perp DEX gets built on their platform. 

Take all the grant money that would've gone to uniswap clones, dogcoins, useless nfts, and 15 different wallet providors and use it to subsidize trader fees and provide initial liquidity. 

As perp DEX tvl grows, so too will demand for supporting infra and that much more likely to lead to organic growth rather than mercenary tvl.
