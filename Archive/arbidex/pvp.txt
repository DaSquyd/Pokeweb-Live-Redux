warzone type pvp game

users pay a fee to enter

users are randomly (tbd how to randomizee) placed in a grid

start of each epoch, 
    users are granted two points. 

during each epoch
    Points can be used to attack a square, defend, or move (can attack own square)
    attacks can be done with any number of points, 
    defense can be done with any number of points
    if attack > defense, defender is dies and their entry fee goes to attacker
    can designate a square to move to (more than 1 player can be on a square)


at the end of each epoch
    remove killed players and allocate fees
    move players to their chosen squares


special cases
    if multiple players kill each other at same time, their fees get distributed to all players equally
    if last multiple players kill each other at same time, they split the pot
    if multiple players attack one square, it counts as an attack with points combined
    if multiple players are on one square and self attack, the attack counts as points combined, but defense is separate
