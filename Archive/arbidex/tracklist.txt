Reflections: 2023 q1

Pros:
Caught the move up from 1350
Caught the move down from 1550
Caught the move back up from 1550
Vela farming

Cons:
Noticed usdc troubles but didn't instantly cash out, could've just closed current positions, and reopened with usdt but was too cheap
Turbo longed at 1600 only for market to dump (maybe would've been good r/r?)


Lessons:
Be faster to dodge systemic risk as soon as you notice (ust/luna/usdc)
Don't blind copy trade ak after initial move has played out
Be more patient to enter 
faster to get out
start of alt season, ape with conviction, try not to get shaken out
end of alt season, stop aping
