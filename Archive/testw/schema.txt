(240k traders)
(728k actions) get from graph




-track trading hours to get likely timezone



Traders need to be searchable by can pnl by variable time period (last 24h, 7d, 30d, custom time period)
		filter by win count, min trades, min avg size, min profit percent

Need a fast way to get pnl, win_count, trade_count, and profit percent for any time frame


Solution 2
	Store pnl for every trader at every action taken
	When user selects timeframe
	pnl is calculated using two closests actions and adjusting based on price oracle

Price oracle can just get the action closest to the timestamp requested and use price from there



advanced OI view
	see what percentage of long/short traders are hisotrically profitable on (x timeframe) (is it the idiots eing long rn or the smart money) ((filter out large wallets like ak))


need to know the pnl and position of every trader at any point in time
	-to be searchable by pnl for any time frame

{
  trades(where: { account: "0xe8c19db00287e3536075114b2576c70773e039bd" },orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: asc) {

    increaseList {

    decreaseList {

    closedPosition {

    liquidatedPosition {

  }
}

If the team doesn't pump every cent of profit made during beta into minting/trading incentives, the launch is gonna be dead on arrival
